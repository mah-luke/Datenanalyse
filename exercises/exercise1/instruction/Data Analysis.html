		<h1>First Exercise</h1>

	</div>
	<div class="framed">
		<p><strong>Attention: These assignments are generated individually for every student!</strong></p>
		<h2>Hints</h2>
		<p>
			The tasks and documentations need to be done with Rmarkdown. A 
template (.Rmd file) is available in TUWEL, together with the resulting 
.pdf file. You can load the Rmarkdown file in RStudio, and execute it 
with the button knitr. General instructions to Rmarkdown are also 
available in TUWEL.
		</p>
		<h2>Preparation</h2>
		<p class="indent">
			Install R from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org</a> and preferably also RStudio from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a>.
			Install the add-on package StatDA with the command <code>install.packages("StatDA")</code>
			(you need to be connected to the internet) and load this package with <code>library(StatDA)</code>.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			In this exercise we use data from the Kola project. Within this 
project, soil samples have been collected at several places of the 
			<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola">Peninsula Kola</a>
			and they were investigated for the concentrations of a number of chemical elements.
			The soil samples have been distinguished in 4 soil layers (<em>moss</em>, <em>ohorizon</em>,
			<em>bhorizon</em> und <em>chorizon</em>). The data from each layer are
			available in separate data sets. These data sets can be loaded with
			the commands <code>data(moss)</code>, <code>data(ohorizon)</code>, etc.
		</p>
		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<h3 class="indent">Example 1</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem indent">
				<p>
					Show a histogram (siehe <code>?hist</code>) of the variable <em>Pt</em>
					from the soil layer <em>chorizon</em>.
					You can get access to this variable with the <code>$</code>-operator (<code>chorizon$Pt</code>).
					What is a histogram? Does it make sense or is it even necessary to first transform the variable?
				    In case you have done a transformation, explain why.
				</p>
				<p>
					Add to this histogram two further histograms for the (transformed) data, but this time use the
					method “Friedman-Diaconis” for the number of histogram bins
					(to select with the parameter <code>breaks="FD"</code>), and once equidistant 
					classes with 5 classes (corresponding to a bin width of 2).
					The parameter <code>breaks</code> of the function <code>hist</code> only allows to roughly control the number of classes.
					It can be necessary to use your own generation of the interval boundaries using <code>seq</code>.
					With the command <code>par(mfrow = c(3, 1))</code> you can place 3 plots on top of each other (see also <code>?par</code>).
					Explain briefly the differences in the histogram class assignments.
					Which class assignment describes you data best, and why?
				</p>
				<p>
					Add two kernel density estimates to the histograms.
					The kernel density estimation can be computed with the command <code>density</code>. Compute the
					first kernel density estimation with the <em>gaussian</em> kernel, and the second one with a 
					<em>cosine</em> kernel. Draw both kernel density estimates as lines with the command
					<code>lines</code> (<code>lines</code> draws into an existing plot)
					by using two different colors (see parameter <code>col</code> of the command
					<code>lines</code>). It might be necessary to adjust the plot window (parameter <code>ylim</code> and <code>xlim</code>).
					How appropriate are the two different kernels for the estimation?
					Which of these kernel is better suited for this task?

		<h3 class="indent">Example 2</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem indent">
				<p>
				    Use for this example the data <code>Diamond</code> from the R package <code>library(Ecdat)</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Draw boxplots with notches for the prices of the diamonds grouped by variable
				    <code>clarity</code>.
				    Note that the price is trivially higher for heavier diamonds, and thus the weight
				    (variable <code>carat</code>) needs to be subtracted out. This could be done by considering
				    <code>price/carat</code> instead of <code>price</code>, but this solution might still not be optimal,
				    and thus other approaches should be tested as well.
				    (Hint: the normalized price should not show a dependency from the variable <code>carat</code>).
				</p>
				<h4>Questions:</h4>
				<ul>
				    <li>What is the meaning of the box and of the notches in the boxplot?</li>
				    <li>Can you recognize certain groups as being especially cheap/expensive?</li>
				    <li>Are the medians of the groups significantly different from each other (look at the notches)?</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>R help:</h4>
				<ul>
				    <li>R allows for the use of formulas which are mainly for the purpose of describing models.
				        For example, <code>y ~ x</code> means that variable <code>y</code> is modeled (or described) by variable <code>x</code>.
				        More explanations can be found in <code>help(formula)</code></li>
				    <li>Boxplots are drawn with the command boxplot, and the notches can be shown with the paramter <code>notch</code>.
				        Note that the function boxplot can work with formulas. E.g., <code>boxplot(y ~ grp1, data =
				            mydata)</code>
				        creates extra boxplots of y for each group <code>grp1</code>, and this information needs to be available in the object
				        <code>mydata</code>.
				    </li>
				</ul>

		<h3 class="indent">Example 3</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem indent">
				<p>
					Generate 100 realizations of a random variable with distribution Binomialverteilung
					and parameters <em>size = 94, prob = 0.2</em> and from a distribution Normalverteilung with parameters
					<em>mean = -1, sd = 7.4</em>. This can be done with the command <code>x.desc &lt;- rbinom(100, size = 94, prob = 0.2)</code>
					and <code>x.cont &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = -1, sd = 7.4)</code>.
					Now draw the empirical distribution function (<code>?ecdf</code>) 
of both random vectors
					using different colors into one plot. Draw two separate plots if 
the scale of the empirical distribution functions is very different and 
thus they cannot
					be combined into one plot (explain this in the documentation).
					How is the empirical distribution function defined? Describe the 
differences that you see in the 
					discrete and continuous random variable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plot also the empirical distribution functions of the Kola project variables <em>Na</em>,
					<em>As</em> and <em>Pb</em> from the layer <em>ohorizon</em> (if necessary,
					the data should first be transformed). Interpret the results and the differences 
					in teh empirical distribution functions.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3 class="indent">Example 4</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem indent">
				<p>
					Draw randomly 500 values from a normal distribution with mean -8 and standard deviation
					2.06 (<code>x &lt;- rnorm(500, -8, 2.06)</code>).
					Use the function <code>qqplot.das</code> to show a QQ-plot with the generated values.
					Are the parameters of the underlying normal distribution visible in the plot, and if so, how?
					For this task, the function <code>grid</code> could be heplful, since it shows a grid in an existing plot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now show a QQ-plot of the 3 (possibly transformed) variables from Example 3. The QQ-plot
					of the first variable can be generated with <code>qqplot.das</code>. The remaining variables
					should appear in the same plot but with different colors (can be done with the parameter <code>add.plot</code>
					in the function <code>qqplot.das</code>).
					if necessary, adjust the plotting regions with the parameters <code>xlim</code> and <code>ylim</code>.
					Show the graphs in separate plots if the data do not fit into one 
plot (even when adjusting the plot), and provide a reasoning for that in
 the documentation.
					Can you see specific patterns of the data in the QQ-plot?
					Do the QQ-plots support your conclusions from Example 3?
