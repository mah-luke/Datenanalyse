		<h2>Hints</h2>
		<p>
            The tasks and documentations need to be done with Rmarkdown. A template (.Rmd file) is available in TUWEL, 
            together with the resulting .pdf file. You can load the Rmarkdown file in RStudio, and execute it with 
            the button knitr. General instructions to Rmarkdown are also available in TUWEL.
		</p>
		<h2>Remark:</h2>
		<p class="indent">
			Please, make sure in your plots to visualize the whole data range, in x- as well as in y- direction!
		</p>
		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<h3 class="indent">Example 1: Multivariate graphics</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem1 indent">
				<p>
					Load the data from the file <strong>ice.RData</strong> (TUWEL) into R.
					These data contain in the first 8 columns the fatty acid values measured in tissue samples of human mummies.
					The column <code>code</code> classifies the observations into 6 groups, und the column <code>group</code>
					provides a more detailed description of the objects. For instance, <em>iceman</em> is our good old Ã–tzi, <em>glac</em>
					refers to corpses found on gaciers, and <em>fresh</em> refers to fresh tissue samples of recently deceased people (details in the book of Varmuza und Filzmoser, 2009).
				</p>
				<p>
				Draw a segment and a star plot (<code>stars()</code>) of the first 8 columns of the <code>ice</code> data.
					Use as graphics <code>labels</code> the names from the column <code>group</code> (this column can be
					converted to character with the command <code>as.character</code>). Add a legend to the plot, and take care 
					that the graphs, the labels and the legend are well visible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, plot the first 8 columns of the <code>ice</code> data as parallel coordinates 
					(function <code>parcoord</code> from package MASS), and use the column <code>code</code> to color
					the lines. Try to change the sorting of the variables to better reveal the data structure.
				</p>
				<h4>Questions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Which joint properties between the mummies can you see in the plot with the segments or stars,
					and do these correspond to the column <code>group</code>? Is this better visible in the 
					parallel coordinate plot?</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>R help:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The segment plot can be drawn with the command <code>stars</code> and the parameter
						<code>draw.segments = TRUE</code>. A legend can be added with the parameter
						<code>key.loc</code>.</li>
					<li>A stars plot can be drawn with the same command as for segments, but the parameter
					<code>draw.segments</code> needs to be set to <code>FALSE</code>.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3 class="indent">Example 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem2 indent">
				<p>Carry out a PCA for the data set 
				<code>data(decathlon)</code> from the package <code>FactoMineR</code>.
                Hereby use an individually generated data subset with the following instruction:
                <code>decathlon[c("Rank", "Rank", "Points", "Javeline", "400m", "1500m", "Competition", "Shot.put", "Discus")]</code></p>
				<p>Have also a look at the packages <code>caret</code> and <code>PCA</code>.
				</p>
				<h4>Questions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Explain the idea of PCA, and explain briefly the mathematical background.</li>
					<li>Why can a data transformation sometimes be of advantage?</li>
					<li>Which kind of transformation would be appropriate?</li>
					<li>How can you select an appropriate number of components a) graphically b) with R (R functions)?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Perform PCA with an appropriate data transformation (if necessary), determine the number of 
				components using a function (see last question), and visualize the results.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3 class="indent">Example 3: Cluster analysis</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem3 indent">
				<p>Describe briefly the goal of cluster analysis.</p>
				<p>Mention at least 5 different clustering procesures, and describe 2 of them briefly.
				    Refer also to the corresponding R functions. Explain also the meaning of distance measure in this context.</p>
				<p>How can a meaningful and useful number of clusters be determined?</p>
				<p>Carry out different cluster analysis methods for the data set <code>olive</code> from the 
				package <code>pgmm</code>.
				    The data are in your folder
				    <strong>oliveSample_11908553.RData</strong>.
				    Read these data into R (see R help of the first example).
				    Visualize the data appropriately. For this purpose, you can get inspired by
				    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dendextend/vignettes/Cluster_Analysis.html">Inspiration Visualization</a>. Hereby, compare the clustering results to the true and correct groups similar as in
				    <a href="http://www.rdatamining.com/examples/kmeans-clustering">Example Clustering</a>.
				    Perform 3 different clustering procedures and compare the results. Argue why data points can be 
				    assigned to different groups, depending on the procedure.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3 class="indent">Example 4: Discriminant analysis</h3>
		<div class="indent">
			<div class="problem4 indent">
				<p>Describe briefly the idea behind discriminant analysis, and how it works. Explain the difference 
				to cluster analysis.</p>
				<p>Hint: Use the package <code>MASS</code> and <code>car</code> for the following tasks.</p>
				<p>This time we analyze the following data set: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data">Wine</a></p>
				<p>Try to get an overview of these data with the function 
				<code>scatterplotMatrix</code>.</p>
				<p>Which R function can be used to obtain summary statistics for multivariate data?</p>
				<p>Split the data set according to the proportions <code>70:30</code> into a training and a test set.
				Carry out LDA for the following data subsets: 1)
				    <code>wine[c("V1", "Proline", "Hue", "Ash")]</code>
				    2) <code>wine[c("V1", "Alcalinity", "Alcalinity", "Nonflavanoid", "Phenols", "OD280", "Ash", "Flavanoids", "Intensity", "Hue")]</code>.</p>
				<p>Make use of the function <code>predict</code> to predict the class memberships for the test data,
				and compare the predictions with the true class memberships. Visualize the results.</p>
